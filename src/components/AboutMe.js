      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Ashna Aqeel Raza, a passionate computer science student on a journey to explore the endless possibilities of technology.<br></br> Currently pursuing my degree in computer science, I thrive on the excitement of solving complex problems and the creativity involved in crafting innovative solutions. <br></br>

My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in programming languages like C++, Java, Phython, JavaScript, algorithms, <br></br>and data structures. I am deeply interested in Front End projects, where I can apply my skills to make a meaningful impact.<br></br>

Outside of the academic realm, I love to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech world, participate in coding competitions, and engage in collaborative projects.<br></br> I believe in the power of technology to transform ideas into reality, <br></br>and I am eager to contribute my skills to the ever-evolving field of computer science.</p>
